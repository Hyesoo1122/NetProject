## Problem statement

Finding like-minded individuals to collaborate on projects or studies can be challenging. This difficulty is compounded by the need for diverse skill sets, such as front-end and back-end development, as well as project management, to successfully execute projects. Traditional methods of networking within educational institutions often result in limited access to individuals with the required expertise.

Moreover, the increasing trend towards interdisciplinary collaboration necessitates platforms that facilitate connections between individuals from various backgrounds. With remote work becoming more prevalent, geographical constraints are diminishing, creating opportunities for collaboration beyond local networks.

In response to these challenges, there's a need for a dedicated platform to simplify the process of finding project collaborators. Such a platform would streamline connections based on shared interests and required skills, fostering more effective collaboration for successful project outcomes.

## Background

Many projects originate from uni societies, but there's a growing need for individuals outside these circles to find collaborators for portfolio-building projects. While social networking apps offer opportunities, they're time-consuming since not all users want to join the project. Therefore, there's a demand for a dedicated platform focused solely on connecting individuals seeking project partners. This app aims to streamline this process for those prioritizing practical project experiences over broad networking goals.

## Target users

The primary users of this website are students who are actively engaged in their studies and seek opportunities to participate in projects or collaborative studies to enhance their portfolios. Additionally, individuals who are keen on finding study partners or joining projects or study groups are expected to be the main users of the platform.

## Minimum Viable Product/Prototype

* Users need to sign up to the website and will successfully signup page.
* Users need to create a list of projects and descriptions. This includes adding a project to the list, and displaying a list of project.

    * Details of a project include:
        * Project title
        * Project description
        * Number of recruits (with number range)
        * How it works (offline/online)
        * Recruitment deadline (date time)
        * Duration of the project/study
        * Technology stack (Javascript, typescript, java ,, )
        * Recruitment position (Front-end, Back-end, PM, Designer, IOS, Android)
        * How to contact




## User Interface Design

*Create images of what the user will see as they use your MVP.*

*For the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) what would the user see when they first open your application? What different actions could they take? What would they be shown next? Include all elements of the display, inputs, buttons which would be shown on the screen.*

*We expect at least 2 to 4 displays for each project, but the exact number of displays/impages depends on your project. Label/annotate each display as needed so that a person unfamiliar with your project can see what you intend to implement.*

*The drawings may be done:*
 - *by hand (take photos of the hand-drawn images to get them onto your computer)*
 - *using any computer application*

*The images should then be either:*
 - *embedded into this document*
 - *included as separate, well-labelled (eg screen1.jpg, screen2.jpg etc) in the zip file you're submitting. (Separate files must be of type .jpg, .jpeg or .png.)*



## Implement First Stage of MVP

*Your code must compile and run in order to get these marks.*

*This section must be submitted in the `first_stage.py` file.*

*Using your user interface and the code provided in `first_stage.py` as a starting point, write a flask server for your application. The server should have all the required routes for your MVP, each one returning the required HTML to the browser. Your first stage should be able to display each of the web pages and allow users to enter information, but does not need to store or process any information.*

*For web pages which involve displaying information in a certain layout, for this stage you may hard-code some sample data within the route which needs to display the data. When you later go to implement your back end, the hard-coded sample data would be replaced with accessing the information entered by the user.*

*For the purpose of this assignment, MVPs do not require data to persist from one execution of the program to another. Having an MVP which is useful as long as the user does not close the application and re-open it, is sufficient. If persistent data is desirable, it should be included as the first NTH (Nice to Have feature).*




## "Nice to have" features

* Users need to be able to show their interest in each project of study. This includes adding users to the list and displaying a list of interested people.
Details of a User include:
    * Name
    * Department
    * Availability
* Users need to be able to get a list of projects or studies that suit their requirements. (using filtering function)
* Users would like to be able to add project or study with description
* Users would like to be able to join to the project or study
* Users would like to be able to remove itself from the project
* From the reference website, users would like to be able to click on a link to check what the project exactly for
* From the search results, users would like to be able to search right project that matches to their requirements

## Stretch goals

* Different users in one website can check each others profile
* Users can save the list of the project to look over later
* Users can like or dislikes of the project
* show the count of the views of the each project
* Warning when project expire soon
* Users abel to add comments on the detail page
